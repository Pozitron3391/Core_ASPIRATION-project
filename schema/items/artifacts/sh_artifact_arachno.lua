ITEM.description = "A spindly artifact with many long, twisting 'legs'."
ITEM.longdesc = "The name 'Arachno' comes from its resemblance to a spider, as well as the fact that some of the ends of the legs are coated in a thin film of a venomous substance. This substance is a strong neuromuscular-blocking agent, able to completely paralyse a horse, let alone a man. There isn't much danger to stabbing yourself with it however, as the material is slightly brittle, and anything harder than bare skin will cause the venom-coated tendril to snap off rather than penetrate the skin."

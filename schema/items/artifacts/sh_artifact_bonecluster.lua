It is unknown where this artifact comes from, as it has been observed near almost every kind of anomaly, although mostly around the chemical types. It is a quite common artifact, without any observable special properties, however its strange structure and the fact that it seems to be human bone mass that is warped into this grotesque shape interests scientists."

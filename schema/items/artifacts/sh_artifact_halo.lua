ITEM.longdesc = "The symbolic value of this artifact needs no introduction, being a staple of many religions. Dubbed the 'Crown of Immortality' by many of a more religious background, some believe it protects one from death itself. There is no proof of this happening, as many a STALKER have been found dead with a Halo in his possession. Nevertheless, the legend of the Halo makes it a popular artifact, especially among STALKERs, however the scientists also have an interest in figuring out why it has that eerie glow."
